Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder


A simple Python program that implements the classic Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. This program allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift cipher method.


📋 Features

Encrypt text: Convert plain text into cipher text using a custom shift value

Decrypt text: Convert cipher text back to plain text using the same shift value

Input validation: Handles invalid inputs gracefully without crashing

Case preservation: Maintains original letter case (uppercase/lowercase)

Non-alphabet character handling: Leaves numbers, symbols, and spaces unchanged


🔧 Requirements

Python 3.x (no additional packages required)


🚀 How to Use

Running the Program

Save the script as caesar\_cipher.py

Open a terminal/command prompt

Run the program:

bash

python caesar\_cipher.py


Program Flow

Start the program: You'll see the welcome message

Enter your text: Type the message you want to encrypt or decrypt

Enter shift value: Choose a number between 1 and 25

This is the number of positions each letter will be shifted

The same shift must be used for both encryption and decryption


Choose operation:

Type E or ENCRYPT to encrypt your text

Type D or DECRYPT to decrypt your text

View results: The program displays both original and processed text


Example Usage

Encryption Example:

text

\=== Caesar Cipher Program ===

Enter the text: Hello World

Enter the shift value (1-25): 13

Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? E

Original text: Hello World

Encrypted text: Uryyb Jbeyq


Decryption Example:

text

\=== Caesar Cipher Program ===

Enter the text: Uryyb Jbeyq

Enter the shift value (1-25): 13

Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? D

Encrypted text: Uryyb Jbeyq

Decrypted text: Hello World


📝 How the Caesar Cipher Works

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Example with shift 3:

A → D

B → E

C → F

...

X → A

Y → B

Z → C


Formula:

Encryption: E(x) = (x + shift) mod 26

Decryption: D(x) = (x - shift) mod 26

Where x is the position of the letter in the alphabet (0-25).


⚠️ Limitations

Shift range: Only supports shift values from 1 to 25

Alphabet: Only works with English alphabet characters (A-Z, a-z)

Security: NOT secure for real encryption - easy to crack

Special characters: Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged


🛠️ Code Structure

The program consists of several functions:

caesar(): Core encryption/decryption logic

encrypt(): Wrapper function for encryption

decrypt(): Wrapper function for decryption

get\_valid\_shift(): Validates user input for shift value

main(): Main program flow and user interaction


🔒 Security Note

This is an educational tool only! The Caesar cipher is extremely weak and should never be used for actual secure communication. It can be easily broken by:

Brute force (only 25 possible keys)

Frequency analysis

Known plaintext attacks
